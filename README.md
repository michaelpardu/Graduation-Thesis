## Introduction

Electrocardiography (ECG) is a vital tool in monitoring heart health. This project aims to create a user-friendly system for acquiring and visualizing ECG signals using a single lead. The combination of ESP32 hardware and various software technologies allows for high-speed sampling and real-time data visualization.

## Features

- **Real-time ECG Signal Acquisition**: Capture ECG signals with high accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Display ECG waveforms in real-time for immediate analysis.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with ReactJS for easy interaction.
- **Data Processing**: Utilize Python for backend processing of the ECG data.
- **High-speed Sampling**: Leverage the ESP32's capabilities for efficient data handling.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Hardware**: ESP32 microcontroller for data acquisition.
- **Programming Languages**: 
  - Python 3 for backend processing.
  - JavaScript for frontend development.
- **Frameworks**: 
  - ReactJS for building the user interface.
- **Libraries**: 
  - Cosine LUT for signal processing.
  - I2S ADC for high-speed sampling.

## Installation
